Today, we’re announcing that we've paid out $2 million in STORJ tokens to our network of Storage Node Operators. This is massive, and we’re so proud to have a community of Storage Node Operators helping us build the future of the internet by putting their extra disc space and bandwidth to work.

We’re also thrilled to hit this milestone because of what it means for the sharing economy of digital resources. While $2 million in STORJ tokens is a great achievement for Storj Labs and our network of Storage Node Operators, we expect as we see broader adoption of our Tardigrade service, this number will increase and further prove the value of putting unused digital resources to work.

We currently have about 5,500 Storage Node Operators on the Storj network. At its peak, our V2 network had more than 100,000 different Nodes! If you have HDD space to spare and want to help us create the internet of tomorrow, then [please sign up to become a Storage Node Operator](https://storj.io/sign-up-node-operator/). You’ll help securely store encrypted data from Tardigrade cloud storage users and be part of a private and completely decentralized cloud solution. You don’t need extra hardware, just a solid internet connection and enough hard drive space. 

We’re excited to see what 2020 has in store for decentralized solutions, and we can’t wait to pay out even more Storj tokens to our Storage Node Operators. Most of all, we’re thrilled to see secure, decentralized cloud storage in action and believe it’s the key to a better digital world.
