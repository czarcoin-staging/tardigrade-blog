In our town hall last week, our team shared updates on our Open Source Partner Program; Storage Node Operator payouts; and an overview of our [early access production release for our Tardigrade decentralized cloud storage service](https://storj.io/blog/2020/01/announcing-early-access-for-tardigrade/). Watch to learn what this early access release will mean going forward for Storage Node Operators and Tardigrade users.

If you missed it on Zoom, you can watch the YouTube replay below. Closed captioning is available.
